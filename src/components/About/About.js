        With a passion for digitalizing, data analysis I have both the skill set
        and professional background necessary to dive deep into DataBases. And
        being an intensive database developer made me professional in this
        field. Also, having good cloud knowledge and working on products like
        Amazon AWS, Google GCP pulled me towards Cloud computing and AI. As an
        upbeat, self-motivated team player with good communication, I envision
        an exciting future in Computing and Data Science. Browse my site to see
        all that I have to offer and download my resume.
